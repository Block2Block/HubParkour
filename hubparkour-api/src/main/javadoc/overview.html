    <p>Welcome to the HubParkour Developer API. Here, you can look at the Developer API for expanding HubParkour's functionalities.</p>
    <p>The main class is <a href="me/block2block/hubparkour/api/HubParkourAPI.html"><code>HubParkourAPI</code></a>, which is where you'll
            find common functions you may need. A list of Events fired by the plugin can found here in the
    <a href="me/block2block/hubparkour/api/events/package-summary.html"><code>events package</code></a>.</p>
    <p>This API is offered with support. However, there are certain functions relating to the API that I will not support with. These include but is not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Any actions performed on non-API classes. For example, if you inject the jar directly into your project, or build the project locally, I offer
                no support for any bugs that may occur as a result.</li>
        <li>Custom implementations of the Backend API.</li>
        <li>Reflection on any class.</li>
    </ul>
