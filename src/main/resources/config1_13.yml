# This is the default configuration file for the "HubParkour" by Block2Block.
#
# Do not remove any of the different values. They cannot be disabled, however
# I may introduce a system for them to be disabled in the near future if there
# is enough demand. If you do remove values, the plugin will just load them in
# again with their default values. The same occurs when there is an invalid value
# used.
#
# I have worked quite hard on the plugin to make it as configurable as possible. Please
# rate it on the Spigot page! Every review helps!
#
# If you have any questions, bug reports or suggestions, feel free to add it as an
# issue on the GitHub.
#
# Most of the settings/messages are self explanatory, but I have explained the less obvious ones.

# DO NOT REMOVE THIS LINE.
